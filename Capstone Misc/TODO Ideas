Custom event logger- Event[0] style. Use a public static method within its own class with 3 callables: setPath(String) which sets where the log should go when printed, addEvent(String) which adds an event to the current stack, and panic() which prints out the stack at the requested folder.
Meant to be used to help debug, and when something goes into a failure mode, e.g. catching an exception that cannot be corrected, panic() should be called.

Pattern compiler/ creation- Uses strings and a custom class to parse the String, and then uses math and loops and timers to create the requested patterns. Should have a for loop, a wait timer, a setter, and a color shifter (for rainbow). Other functions should be implemented as seen fit.
